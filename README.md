# A-Pinecode-for-friend
AI-Powered Human Matchmaking App based on Pinecone and React Native

This repository contains the code for a mobile application designed to help individuals find compatible connections in new environments. Developed with React Native and Expo, this app utilizes cutting-edge AI vector embeddings to enable intelligent matchmaking based on semantic similarity, moving beyond basic filtering.

At its core, the app leverages Pinecone, a powerful vector database, for efficient storage and retrieval of user profiles, matching individuals based on the deep meaning captured in their personal descriptions. A lightweight Node.js micro-server serves as the secure backend, managing user data and orchestrating the AI-driven matching process with Pinecone.

This project aims to facilitate new social interactions by intelligently connecting people with shared interests and complementary profiles.
